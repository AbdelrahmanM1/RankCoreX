# ===========================================
# RankCorex - Ranks Configuration
# ===========================================
# Define all ranks here.
# Each rank has:
#   prefix     → Appears before player name.
#   suffix     → Appears after player name.
#   weight     → Higher = more priority (used for sorting, inheritance later).
#   default    → Only one rank can be "true". Assigned if no other rank.
#   permissions → List of permission nodes this rank has.
#
# Permission Examples:
#   essentials.fly          → Specific permission
#   essentials.*            → All essentials permissions
#   -*                      → Remove all permissions (use carefully!)
#   -essentials.ban         → Remove specific permission
#   *                       → ALL permissions (admin only!)
#
# Permission Priority:
#   Negative permissions (-permission) override positive ones
#   More specific permissions override wildcards
